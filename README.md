# MLB Immaculate Grid Clone

## Description
A clone based on the popular [Immaculate Grid web game](https://www.immaculategrid.com/), made using React.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository by entering the following into your terminal: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannyjimenez98/MLB-Grid-Game.git
```
2. Change into project's directory
```bash
cd mlb-grid
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```
This should open the browser automatically, but if it does not, just go to `http://localhost:3000` to play.
5. Guess away and have fun!

## How to Play
- The game consists of a 3x3 grid with six different teams positioned at the beginning of each row and column of squares on the grid.
- Each square on the grid corresponds with the two MLB teams from the same row and column. The goal is to guess an MLB player that played at least one game for both teams in his career. 
- Each player can only be used once.
- You have 9 chances to correctly answer the nine squares on the board.
- To make a guess, click on a square and type in a player you think would work as an answer for that square and click the green 'Select' button next to their name.

# MLB-Grid-Game

Immaculate Grid Clone built with React. You have 9 guesses to correctly answer an MLB player who has played for the two teams in each grid.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
